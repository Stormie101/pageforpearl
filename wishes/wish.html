        <p>Hey Sayang, hope that everytime when you read this, you're having a wonderful day and a week full of smile. i wrote this before my convocation and I really can't wait to finally get to see you again after a long time.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry that I took the initiative and declare the take a break phase and cakap that the period would be 6 - 8 month when truly I just want us to take a break until I finish up my Internship, I knoww that I should have just told you the truth but where the fun in that right😂</p>
        <p>I love you to my very heart and soul, everything about you make me fall in love day after day. tahu2 dah 4 tahun 😌</p>
        <p>Anyway, My wish for you is that you will always has a smile in your face and to always dapat what you were wishing for because you truly deserve the world ❤️</p>
        <p>I know that I should'nt have said this because buat you marah je tapi I just want to let you know that if you were to find someone that can treat you better then I do just let me know, I'll try to be better then him.</p>

        <p>I Love You Sayang <br> Always ❤️</p>
