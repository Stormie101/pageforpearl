            <p>
                The first time I see her,<br>
                she was a a nobody but a stranger in my heart and soul,<br>
                now that she's mine,<br>
                she's everything to me as if I've known her my whole life
            </p>

                We've known each other for 4 Years! and soon to enter our 5th year anniversary <br>
                in 19th july 2024. The funniest thing about our anniversary date is that we both <br>
                always fight over in which date we started dating since I accepted her as my <br>
                love of my life in the middle of the night.

            <p id="ayat-manis">
                She's one of the most beautiful women that I've caught my eyes on and for these <br>
                past years, I've been praying that our fate to be lover will stay forever through <br>
                Here and after ❤️

                She's into psychology especially dark psychology because she has always called <br> 
                herself a psycho but in my eyes and heart. she's nothing but a 'supergiant star' <br>
                that bright up my universe (●'◡'●)
