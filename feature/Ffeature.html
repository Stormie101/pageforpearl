            BUT, if I were to describe on what is so damn
            great about her. I would describe her as a person that are perfectly balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            She has the right balance between good vibe and toxicity. She has that CUTE and marvelous personality
            in which I would never get bored of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some might be wondering on why do i still date her even though i admit it that she's a little toxic?<br><br>
            from my view, her toxicity that created drama in our relationship is what made our relationship stronger and spicier.
        </p>
        <p>
            She also has one of the most beautiful eye that i have ever seen in person! macam nak korek je mata <br>
            When she look at me with those deadly eyes, she do something to my soul that made me craaazy. 
        </p>
        <p>Either way, She's the best ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
